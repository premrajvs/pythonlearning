# Assignments
**1. Variables and Data Types:**
Create variables named item_name, item_price, and in_stock. Assign appropriate values (a string, a float, and a boolean) to these variables representing an item in a store. Print the values of each variable.
Declare two integer variables, num1 and num2. Swap the values of these two variables without using a temporary variable. Print the values of num1 and num2 after the swap.
Create a list called student_grades containing three numerical grades. Calculate the average of these grades and store the result in a new variable average_grade. Print the average grade.

**2. Numbers (Integers, Floats):**
Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangle as input (as floats) and calculates its area. Print the area formatted to one decimal place.
Calculate the perimeter of a circle given its radius (take the radius as input as an integer). Use math.pi for the value of pi. Print the perimeter.
Write code to determine if a given integer (take as input) is a multiple of 5. Print "Multiple of 5" or "Not a multiple of 5".

**3. Strings:**
Create a string variable containing a sentence. Write code to count the number of words in the sentence. Print the word count.
Given the string "programming", extract the substring "gram". Print the extracted substring.
Write a program that takes a word as input and checks if it ends with the letter 'g' (case-insensitive). Print True or False.

**4. Lists:**
Create a list of your three favorite colors. Add another color to the end of the list and then remove the second color from the list. Print the final list.
Given the list [10, 25, 5, 30, 15], write code to find the smallest number in the list. Print the smallest number.
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input (separated by spaces) from the user and then prints the list in reverse order.

**5. Tuples:**
Create a tuple representing the coordinates of a point in 2D space (x, y). Print the individual x and y coordinates.
Given the tuple ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"), write code to find the index of the element "cherry". Print the index.
Write a program that creates a tuple containing the first five even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Print the tuple.

**6. Dictionaries:**

Create a dictionary to store the capital cities of three countries (e.g., "USA": "Washington D.C."). Print the capital of one of the countries.
Given the dictionary {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, write code to update the age to 26 and add a new key-value pair "city": "New York". Print the updated dictionary.
Write a program that takes a string as input and counts the frequency of each character in the string (ignoring spaces). Store the results in a dictionary and print it.

**7. Boolean Values (True, False):**
Declare two variables, is_student (boolean) and age (integer). Write a boolean expression that evaluates to True if the person is a student and their age is less than 30. Print the result.
Write code to check if a given number (take as input) is within the range of 10 to 20 (inclusive). Print True or False.
Declare a boolean variable has_license. Write a conditional statement that prints "Can drive" if has_license is True, and "Cannot drive" otherwise.

**8. Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical):**
Write a program that takes the base and height of a parallelogram as input and calculates its area. Print the area.
Write code that takes two numbers as input and checks if at least one of them is greater than 10. Print True or False.
Evaluate the expression 15 % 4 + 3 * 2 ** 3 - 1. Write code to calculate and print the result.

**9. Input and Output (print(), input()):**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter their favorite programming language and then prints a message like "Your favorite programming language is [language]".
Write code that takes the price of an item and the quantity purchased as input from the user (as floats and integers, respectively). Calculate the total cost and print it with a clear message.
Write a program that asks the user for their name and age on separate lines and then prints a sentence combining this information.

**10. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):**
Write a program that takes a number as input and prints whether it is even or odd.
Write a program that takes a student's grade (A, B, C, D, or F) as input and prints a corresponding message (e.g., "Excellent!", "Good", "Average", "Passing", "Failed").
Write a program that takes the current month as input (as a string) and prints the number of days in that month (you can assume February has 28 days for simplicity).
